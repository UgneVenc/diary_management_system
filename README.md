# diary_management_system
Diary management system coded in C++ | File management | Login/Signup 

Still not finished but i will implament more things in the future.
Right now people van sign up and log in to the diary system and you can add entrys.
Loging in requires a password and a username ith the system remembers.

In the future i am planing to implament:
- edit entry function
- delete entry function
- delete account function
- encrypt the text inside the entry and users passwords
- fix a bug that occurs when people make their usernames more then one word
- fix a bug that occurs when people enter their dates with spaces in between them
